# Motivation

There is presently no application that employs geospatial analysis techniques such as buffering or raster density maps to access the availability of health-advocating amenities from all the three main aspects as mentioned above.

Our application will provide an easy to understand and user-friendly GUI, but will also contain a degree of technical depth such that urban planners can identify and resolve any potential lapses or areas of improvement.

# Objectives

* To build a GIS tool using R Shiny
* Within each subzone, analyse the demand (segmented by age group) and supply of healthy living facilities such as gyms, parks, and healthy eating establishments
* Visualize the proximities of these facilities to residential areas and identify any lapses in accessibility
* Evaluate results of analysis and provide recommendations to further extend the options available for residents to live a healthier lifestyle.
