<div id="description" class="section level1">
<h1>Description</h1>
<p>Our project aims to make use of geospatial intelligence to explore the accessibility of residents to amenities that advocate a healthier lifestyle, and also the spatial patterns involved. The scope of our analysis will involve two main facets of a healthier lifestyle, namely food and exercise.</p>
</div>
<div id="motivation" class="section level1">
<h1>Motivation</h1>
<p>There is presently no application that employs geospatial analysis techniques such as buffering or raster density maps to access the availability of health-advocating amenities from all the three main aspects as mentioned above.</p>
<p>Our application will provide an easy to understand and user-friendly GUI, but will also contain a degree of technical depth such that urban planners can identify and resolve any potential lapses or areas of improvement.</p>
