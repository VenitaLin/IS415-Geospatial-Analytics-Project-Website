# Description

Our project aims to make use of geospatial intelligence to explore the accessibility of residents to amenities that advocate a healthier lifestyle, and also the spatial patterns involved. The scope of our analysis will involve two main facets of a healthier lifestyle, namely food and exercise.


# Motivation

There is presently no application that employs geospatial analysis techniques such as buffering or raster density maps to access the availability of health-advocating amenities from all the three main aspects as mentioned above.

Our application will provide an easy to understand and user-friendly GUI, but will also contain a degree of technical depth such that urban planners can identify and resolve any potential lapses or areas of improvement.

# Objectives

* To build a GIS tool using R Shiny
* Within each subzone, analyse the demand (segmented by age group) and supply of healthy living facilities such as gyms, parks, and healthy eating establishments
* Visualize the proximities of these facilities to residential areas and identify any lapses in accessibility
* Evaluate results of analysis and provide recommendations to further extend the options available for residents to live a healthier lifestyle.

# Reviews of past projects

# Data Sources
* Healthier Eateries 
Dataset for healthier dining partners as eating well is fundamental to good health and well-being. Healthy eating will help Singapore to maintain a healthy body.

* Gyms@SG
Location dataset of exercise facilities around Singapore. Gym helps to increase
cardiovascular fitness, stronger muscles and maintain a healthy body.
